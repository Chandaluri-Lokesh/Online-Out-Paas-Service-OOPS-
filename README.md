# Online-Out-Paas-Service-OOPS-
Online Out Pass Service (OOPS) is a role-based leave and out-pass management system for students, teachers, and wardens. It provides a simple interface for users to request, approve, or reject leave applications efficiently. The system currently stores user details in an Excel file and can be expanded with database integration in the future.
